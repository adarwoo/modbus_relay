# Modbus Relay #

This project is a fully working MODBUS RTU Relay.
The project comes with schematic and PCB, as well as the firmware of course!

The core of the relay is an AVR Tiny1624.
Note: The code optimized with -Os is <16KB. The -Og used typically for debug is <32k. Therefore, for debugging, a 3224 device is required.
Remembed to edit the makefile to specify your device.

This project can be reused for other Modbus devices. A modbus interface generated is provided and makes writting modbus commands very simple.

Example of python configuration:

```python
"device@44": [
        (READ_COILS,            u16(0, 2, alias="addr"),
                                u16(1, 3, alias="qty"),
                                "on_read_coils"),

        (WRITE_SINGLE_COIL,     u16(0, 2, alias="addr"),
                                u16([0xFF00, 0, 0x5500], alias="op"),
                                "on_set_single"),

        (WRITE_MULTIPLE_COILS,  u16(0, alias="from"),
                                u16(3, alias="qty"),
                                u8(1, alias="count"),
                                u8(0, 7, alias="values"),
                                "on_set_multiple"),

        (READ_HOLDING_REGISTERS, u16(0, 2), u16(1, 3), "on_read_info"),
    ]
```
The handling code is just as simple:

```c++
   void on_read_info(uint8_t index, uint8_t qty) {
      Datagram::pack<uint8_t>(qty*2);

      while ( qty-- ) {
         switch(index++) {
         case 0: Datagram::pack( DEVICE_ID ); break;
         case 1: Datagram::pack( HW_VERSION ); break;
         case 2: Datagram::pack( FW_VERSION ); break;
         default:
            Datagram::reply_error(modbus::error_t::illegal_data_value);
         }
      }
   }
```

<b>Solder side of the board</b>

The relay supports the following modbus commands:
- READ_COILS 1-3
- WRITE_SINGLE_COIL Support for 0x5500 to toggle
- WRITE_MULTIPLE_COILS 1-3
- READ_HOLDING_REGISTERS
  1. Version
  2. FW version
  3. HW version

If compiling using the supplied Dockerfile, the elf is 7KB in size, so a ATTiny824 will work.

The device default address is 44 (Decimal).
By default, it runs at 115200 8E1.

KiCAD schematic and PCB are available.

Tested with QModMaster.

I plan to add address and serial configuration modbus command (and eeprom persistence).

## How to build ##
You will need a Linux shell, or WSL shell in Windows.
The tool 'gitman' is required as well as Docker. (docker-ce or else).

### Steps ###
```bash
# Clone this repo
$ git clone https://https://github.com/adarwoo/modbus_relay.git
$ cd modbus_relay
$ gitman update
$ make NDEBUG=1 # Optional, add ARCH=attiny1624 to suit you device
```

The binary modbus_relay.elf can be found in the directory
# Modbus Relay Device User Manual

## Overview
The Modbus Relay Device is a configurable relay controller with Modbus RTU communication.
This document describes how to configure and operate the device, including its default settings, configuration mode, and reset process.

## Factory default settings
The relay comes pre-configured with the following value:

| Configuration     | Default value             | Explanation                                    |
|-------------------|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Slave ID**      | `0x44`                    | The device address is 44 (decimal) by default  |
| **Baud rate**     | `9600`                    | The device talks at 9600 by default            |
| **Serial setup**  | `8N1`                     | 8bits, no parity and 1 stop bit                |
| **Watchdog**      | `0` (off)                 | The watchdog feature is off by default         |


## Resetting the relay to factory default setttings

If the relay is un-responsive, it may have been mis-configured.
The relay can be reset to it's factory default using the following procedure.

1. Power off the relay
2. Configure your Modbus master configuration tool (such as QModMaster) using a baud rate of **9600**, **8 data bits**, **No parity**, and **1 stop bit** (9600 8N1).
3. Ready the following message:

| Field             | Value                     | Explanation                                    |
|-------------------|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Slave ID**      | `0x00`                    | Broadcast address.                             |
| **Function Code** | `0x10`                    | Write multiple holding registers.              |
| **Start Address** | `0x0063`                  | Address of the reset register (40100)          |
| **Quantity**      | `0x0002`                  | Writing 2 registers (32-bit number).           |
| **Byte Count**    | `0x04`                    | 4 bytes of data to follow.                     |
| **Data**          | `0xDEAD 0x5AFE`           | MSW = `0xDEAD`, LSW = `0x5AFE`.                |
| **CRC**           | `0xBAE7`                  | CRC                                            |

4. Power on the relay. All LEDs turn RED for 5 seconds.
5. During that time, send the 'Write multiple register' commmand
6. If the relay receives the command, the LEDs will blink fast for 5 seconds, then turn all on indicating the device was successfully reset
7. Now the device is factory reset and can be reached at its address `44` (0x2C).

## Simple relay operation

In normal mode:
- The device responds only to frames addressed to its **Device ID**.
- The bus operates as configured
- Relays operate based on the configured default positions and command inversion settings.
- Regular coil commands do not respond in configuration mode to prevent mode mixing.

### Supported Modbus Functions
- **Read Coils (Function Code 1):**
  - Addresses `0x0000` to `0x0002` for Relay 0, Relay 1, and Relay 2.
- **Write Single Coil (Function Code 5):**
  - Write `0xFF00` to turn on, `0x0000` to turn off, and `0x5500` to toggle a relay.
- **Write Multiple Coils (Function Code 15):**
  - Write a bit array to set relay states (1 = closed, 0 = open).
- **Read Holding Registers (Function Code 3):**
  - Register `0x0000` (40001): Product ID (`0x3701`).
  - Register `0x0001` (40002): Device Hardware Version (`0xMMmm`, where MM = major, mm = minor).
  - Register `0x0002` (40003): Software Version (`0xMMmm`, where MM = major, mm = minor).
  - Register `0x0008` (40009): Device address
  - Register `0x0009` (40010): Baud rate selection (1/100th of the actual baud rate)
  - Register `0x000A` (40011): Parity. 0=None, 1=Odd, 2=Even
  - Register `0x000B` (40012): Number of stop bits. 1=1 stop bit, 2=2 stop bits
  - Register `0x000C` (40013): Watchdog window size in seconds
  - Register `0x0010` (40017 + 40019): Number of minutes in operation as a 32-bits
  - Register `0x0014` (40019 + 40020): Number of relay 0 movements as a 32-bits
  - Register `0x001A` (40021 + 40022): Number of relay 1 movements as a 32-bits
  - Register `0x001C` (40023 + 40024): Number of relay 2 movements as a 32-bits

## Configuring the device
The factory default communication settings for the relay are:
- Device address is 44
- Baud rate is **9600**
- **8 data bits**
- **No parity**
- **1 stop bit** (9600 8N1).

### Configuration registers available
These can be accessed with a write single register command or the serial settings can be set with 1 write multiple command.

| Register Address | Function                          | Values/Description                    | Factory Default |
|------------------|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|-----------------|
| 40009 (0x0008)   | Device ID                         | 1 to 247                              | 44              |
| 40010 (0x0009)   | 1/100th of the baud Rate          | 12, 24, 48, 96, 192, 384, 576, 1152   | 96              |
| 40011 (0x0010)   | Parity                            | 0 = None, 1 = Odd, 2 = Even           | 0 (None)        |
| 40012 (0x0011)   | Stop Bits                         | 1 or 2                                | 1               |
| 40013 (0x0012)   | Watchdog Timeout (seconds)        | 0 = Disabled, 1->65535                | 0               |

**Note**:  When writting the configuration with a multiple write, all 5 settings must be written in the same transaction.

### Reset the device
The register at 0x63 (40100) can be written with 0xDEAD5AFE to reset the device remotely.
This is usefull to apply any changes made to the settings.
The command will reply, and the leds will flash fast for 2 seconds, then solid (the device is booting).

### Using the watchdog
The relay has a command watchdog which will release the relays following a period of inactivity.
Everytime a valid modbus command is received (including holding register read etc.), the watchdog is reset.
This feature allow for the relays to be atomatically releases if the master was to fail.
The period is given in seconds.
A value of zero (default) turns off the feature.

---

## Troubleshooting
### Cannot Communicate with Device
- Ensure the device is in **configuration mode** or responding to the correct **Device ID**.
- Check baud rate, parity, and stop bit settings.

### Lost Device ID
1. Send a valid broadcast frame to enter configuration mode.
2. Use the default Device ID (`0`) to reset the device via the reset register.

### Relay Does Not Respond
- Verify relay default positions and inversion settings in the holding registers.
- Check the watchdog timeout setting to ensure it isnâ€™t triggering prematurely.

---

## Notes
- Configuration mode is only accessible during the 2-second boot window.
- For security and reliability, avoid using **Device ID 0** for normal operations.
- Always validate CRC and frame format for successful communication.
